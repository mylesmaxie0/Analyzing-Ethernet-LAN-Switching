# Analyzing Ethernet LAN Switching

## Project Overview
This lab demonstrates practical Layer 2 Ethernet switching behavior and packet analysis using Wireshark. The objective is to validate MAC address learning, broadcast flooding, ARP resolution, and unicast frame forwarding through direct packet inspection.

This lab reinforces foundational networking concepts aligned with CCNA-level switching theory and provides hands-on protocol analysis.

## Lab Objectives
- Analyze Ethernet II frame structure
- Observe switch MAC address learning behavior
- Capture and interpret ARP request/reply traffic
- Validate broadcast vs. unicast forwarding
- Inspect ICMP echo traffic at Layer 2 and Layer 3
